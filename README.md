## Demo App

The demo app highlights three common issues (and how to fix them) you may come across when updating your app to support iPhone X and iOS 11.

1. Incomplete cell & header view background coloring in table views.
2. Undesirable search controller appearance & layout in table views.
3. Unsafe layouts in a fake onboarding screen.
